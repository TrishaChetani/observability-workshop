# Workshop

## Learning objectives

* Explain what observability is and why it is valuable
* Experience analysing a distributed system
* Experience using an observability tech stack

## Activities

### Generate a system diagram

Learning objectives:

* Diagram layers of an application
* Describe tools at our disposal

Mechanics:


2) try and define what "normal" is for the system (using tools to see error rates etc)
3) looking at the diagram and "normal" use identify risk areas (more analysis)
4) add monitoring/alerts/something to confirm system stays "normal"
5) war games! using the alerts they have set up to know when problems surface and then jump in

## TODOs

* Readme update about how to start the stack
* Cheatsheet on terms (USE vs RED etc)
* Cheatsheet on commands (docker cli, prom query, kibana query, grafana)
