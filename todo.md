# TODO

* add choreo
* update readme
* add tracing stack
* migrate to k8s

## low prio

* make application runnable with or without mongodb
* have a default image in the app (otherwise gets an error when loading random)?

## open points

* possibly implement a more interesting application
* multi node setup (with ops stack and multiple client stacks) ideally with service discovery (solved by k8s)
